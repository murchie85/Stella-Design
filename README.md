# Stellar-Design
High Level Design of Stellar prototype
**Author** *Adam McMurchie*
**Project** *Stellar Banking Assistant*

**Summary** 
 This project builds on my earlier Stellar banking companion prototype that I demonstrated at the LBG hackathon lastyear, in which I came first place in the Edinburgh Hackathon. 
 
Stellar provides two next-gen services:
* Interactive banking companion - simply ask for your balance with your words, ask where your nearest branch is and to send money to your friend. Stellar is platform agnostic and can be accessed on social media, app, online or telephone. 
1. Banking services advisor and assistant
2. Voice and visual interactivity
3. Platform Agnistic - Social Media Chatbots, facebook, twitter, Stellar App, Telephone and Desktop. 

* Intelligent Dynamic banking assistant
1. Works out you budgets based upon spending history and Stellar Spending Engine
2. Interactive finance management engine
3. On the go advice about your account health and tips on how to save money, where the deals are etc.
