# Stella-Design
High Level Design of Stella prototype
**Author** *Adam McMurchie*
**Project** *Stella Banking Assistant*

**Summary** 
 This project builds on my earlier Stella banking companion prototype that I demonstrated at the LBG hackathon lastyear, in which I came first place in the Edinburgh Hackathon. 
 
Stella provides two next-gen services:
* Interactive banking companion - simply ask for your balance with your words, ask where your nearest branch is and to send money to your friend. Stella is platform agnostic and can be accessed on social media, app, online or telephone. 
1. Banking services advisor and assistant
2. Voice and visual interactivity
3. Platform Agnistic - Social Media Chatbots, facebook, twitter, Stella App, Telephone and Desktop. 

* Intelligent Dynamic banking assistant
1. Works out you budgets based upon spending history and Stella Spending Engine
2. Interactive finance management engine
3. On the go advice about your account health and tips on how to save money, where the deals are etc.
